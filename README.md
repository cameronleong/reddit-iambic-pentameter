# RIP: a Reddit Iambic Pentameter bot

RIP is a bot that scans new comment on the popular message board [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/) to detect iambic pentameter, one of the most famous types of verses in english poetry.

From wikipedia:

> An iambic foot is an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. [...] A standard line of iambic pentameter is five iambic feet in a row

Here's an example of a iambic pentameter that you would typically encounter on reddit:

> this post has been removed for breaking rule 

This line follows the ``0101010101`` stress pattern, here's a breakdown

	this | post | has | been | re | moved | for | brea | king | rule
	 0   |  1   |  0  |  1   | 0  |   1   |  0  |  1   |  0   |  1
